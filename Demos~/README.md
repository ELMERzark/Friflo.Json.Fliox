The examples in this folder are the same examples as in the separate Git repository
[FlioxHub.Demos](https://github.com/friflo/FlioxHub.Demos#-flioxhubdemos-)

The examples here are only used for development of the **JSON Fliox** library itself.  

To evaluate the features of a **Fliox Hub** please use the examples of the repository mentioned above.  
The separate repository is also much smaller and easier to use as it consumes **JSON Fliox** dependencies as nuget packages.
