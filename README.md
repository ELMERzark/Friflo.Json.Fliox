__`SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON 💩 WHERE 💩 💩 💩`__

*Same attitude?* 😉  
*Then you may have a short look at this project*  <br/><br/>

**JSON Fliox** is a **.NET** library supporting **simple** and **efficient** access to **NoSQL** databases via C# or Web clients.  
Its **ORM** enables **Schema** creation. Its **Hub** serve hosted databases using these schemas via HTTP.

The **ORM** client - Object Relational Mapper - is used to access to NoSQL databases via .NET.  
The **Hub** is a service hosting a set of NoSQL databases via an **ASP.NET Core** server.

As Fliox is an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) it has similarities to projects like
[Entity Framework Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_Framework),
[Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails),
[Django](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)) or
[Hibernate](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernate_(Framework)).  
Fliox sets its focus on **NoSQL** databases.
This improves performance and bypass the [object–relational impedance mismatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_impedance_mismatch)

*Pronunciation*: **io** in **Fliox** is same as in **Riot** <br/><br/>

**TL;DR**

A demo server running on AWS - [**DemoHub**](http://ec2-174-129-178-18.compute-1.amazonaws.com/) (EC2 instance: t2-micro, us-east-1)  
The **DemoHub** .NET project is available as example at
[🚀 friflo/FlioxHub.Examples](https://github.com/friflo/FlioxHub.Examples#content) repository.

<br/>

*Note*: JSON Fliox is **not** a UI library. It is designed for simple integration in .NET and Web UI frameworks.

<br/><br/>


## 🌌 **Hub**

namespace **`Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub`**

### **Client**
📄   [README.md](Json/Fliox.Hub/Client/README.md)

Fliox clients are strongly typed C# classes used to access NoSQL databases.  
They are implemented by creating a class e.g. `MyClient` extending `FlioxClient`.  
The database containers are represented as properties in the derived class `MyClient`.  

These classes also acts as a database schemas. They can be assigned to databases hosted on the Hub.  
Doing this enables features like:
- JSON validation of entities aka records
- generation of JSON Schema / OpenAPI or a GraphQL Schema
- generate a single HTML page with a complete schema documentation
- generate a UML class diagram to visualize a database schema
- generate types declared by the database schema for various programming languages
- implementing generic database explorers like the Hub Explorer

The `MyClient` can be used to declare custom database commands using DTO's as input and result types.


### **Host**
📄   [README.md](Json/Fliox.Hub/Host/README.md)

A `HttpHost` instance is used to host multiple NoSQL databases.  
It is designed to be integrated into HTTP servers like **ASP.NET Core**.  
This enables access to hosted databases via HTTP or WebSocket supporting the following Web API's:
- REST
- GraphQL
- Batch API

A `FlioxHub` instance is used to configure the hosted databases, authentication / authorization and Pub-Sub.  
This `FlioxHub` instance need to be passed to the constructor of the `HttpHost`

### **Explorer**
📄   [README.md](Json/Fliox.Hub.Explorer/README.md)

The Hub Explorer is a generic Web UI - a single page application - used to access
databases, containers and entities hosted by a Fliox Hub.  
The Explorer also enables to execute application specific database commands.

[<img src="docs/images/Fliox-Hub-Explorer.png" width="717" height="278">](Json/Fliox.Hub.Explorer/README.md)  
*screenshot: Hub Explorer*

### **DB**
📄   [README.md](Json/Fliox.Hub/DB/README.md)

Provide a set of support databases used to:
- serve the Hub configuration. Schema:
  [ClusterStore](Json.Tests/assets~/Schema/Markdown/ClusterStore/class-diagram.md)
- serve monitoring data. Schema:
  [MonitorStore](Json.Tests/assets~/Schema/Markdown/MonitorStore/class-diagram.md)
- perform user authentication, authorization and management. Schema:
  [UserStore](Json.Tests/assets~/Schema/Markdown/UserStore/class-diagram.md)

### **Protocol**
📄   [README.md](Json/Fliox.Hub/Protocol/README.md)

The Protocol is the communication interface between a `FlioxClient` and a `FlioxHub`.  
Web clients can use this Protocol to access a Hub using the Batch API via HTTP & JSON.

The Protocol is not intended to be used by C# .NET clients directly.  
Instead they are using a `FlioxClient` that is optimized to transform API calls into the Protocol.

## 🌌 **Fliox**

namespace **`Friflo.Json.Fliox`**


### **Schema**
📄   [README.md](Json/Fliox/Schema/README.md)

This module enables transforming schemas expressed by a set of C# classes into
other programming languages and schema formats like:

| Language / Schema     | used in Hub Explorer by ...                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| C#                    |                                                                                                       |
| Typescript            |                                                                                                       |
| Kotlin                |                                                                                                       |
| HTML                  | [![HTML](docs/images/doc.svg)](Json/Fliox/Schema/README.md#html-documentation) links to documentation |
| JSON Schema / OpenAPI | [![OAS](docs/images/oas.svg)](Json/Fliox/Schema/README.md#swagger-ui) links to Swagger UI             |
| GraphQL Schema        | [![GQL](docs/images/gql.svg)](Json/Fliox/Schema/README.md#graphiql) links to GraphiQL                 |

### **Mapper**
📄   [README.md](Json/Fliox/Mapper/README.md)

This module enables serialization / deserialization of C# .NET objects to / from JSON.  
Its feature set and API is similar to the .NET packages:
- [JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json)
- [System.Text.Json](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json)

The module is utilized by the assembly `Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub` to serialize entities and DTO's.  
Its also used for serialization of the supported protocols: REST, GraphQL and Batch API.

<br/><br/>



## 📦 **Project**

```


### **API**

The Fliox **C# .NET** API is [CLS-compliant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.clscompliantattribute#remarks)

The API is available at [**fliox-docs API Reference**](https://github.com/friflo/fliox-docs)


### **Principles**

- dependencies
    - no 3rd party dependencies
    - small size of Fliox assemblies (*.dll) ~ 850 kb in total, 350 kb zipped  
      source code: library 47k LOC, unit tests: 18k LOC
- target for optimal performance
    - maximize throughput, minimize latency, minimize heap allocations and boxing
    - enable task batching as a unit-of-work
    - support bulk operations for CRUD commands
- compact and strongly typed API
    - type safe access to entities and their keys when dealing with containers  
    - type safe access to DTO's when dealing with database commands
    - absence of using `object` as a type
    - absence of utility classes & methods to
        - to use the API in an explicit manner
        - to avoid confusion implementing the same feature in multiple ways
- serialization of entities and messages - request, response & event - are entirely JSON
- Fliox Clients and Hubs are unit testable without mocking
- the **Zero** principles
    - 0 compiler errors and warnings
    - 0 ReSharper errors, warnings, suggestions and hints
    - 0 unit test errors, no flaky tests
    - 0 typos - observed by spell checker
    - no synchronous calls to API's dealing with **IO** like network or disc    
      Instead using `async` / `await`
    - no 3rd party dependencies
    - no heap allocations if possible
    - no noise in `.ToString()` methods while debugging - only relevant state.  
      E.g. instances of `FlioxClient`, `EntitySet<,>`, `FlioxHub` and `EntityDatabase`
    - no surprise of API behavior.  
      See [Principle of least astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)
    - no automatic C# Code formatting - as no Code Formatter supports the code style of this project.  
      That concerns tabular indentation of fields, properties and variables.      
- extensibility
    - support custom database adapters aka providers
    - support custom code / schema generators for new programming languages
- compatibility
    - **.NET Core 3.1** and higher
    - **Unity 2020.1** and higher

## 🔥 Motivation

The main driver of this project is the development of an competitive online multiplayer game -
a still unresolved task in my todo list.  
The foundation to achieve this is commonly a module called *Netcode* in online multiplayer games.  
The key aspects of *Netcode* are: Synchronizing game state, low latency, high throughput, minimal use of system resources, reliability & easy to use API.
As Unity is selected as the Game engine C# .NET is the way to go.

Another objective is to create an open source software project which has the potential to be popular.  
As I have 15+ years experience as a software developer in enterprise environment - Shout-Out to [HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com/) -
I decided to avoid a Vendor Lock-In to Unity and target for a solution which fits also the needs of common .NET projects.
So development is entirely done with .NET Core while checking Unity compatibility on a regular basis.

The result is a project with a feature set useful in common & gaming projects and targeting for optimal performance.  
The common ground of both areas is the need of databases.  
In context of game development the game state (Players, NPC, objects, ...) is represented as an in-memory database.  
In common projects databases are used to store any kind of data persistent by using popular DBMS.  
Specific for online gaming is the ability to send messages from one client to another in *real time*.
This is enabled by supporting Pub-Sub with sub millisecond latency on *localhost*.
