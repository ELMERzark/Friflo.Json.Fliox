## üß© Submitting a Pull Request

For this topic I have to state my expectation in context of this project.

It still have to make fun working with Fliox.  
This is the backing for reliable maintenance of the project in the future.

My personal experience with Pull Requests is - reviewing is time costly, slow and not really fun.  
Also rejecting a Pull Request is not nice for both parties.  
I guess I will be reserved to merge a Pull Request.

Because of this mindset Fliox enables adding useful features without the need to modify source of this repository.  
These are:
- New code generators for new programming languages or schema formats.
- New database adapters for unsupported databases.
- Adding custom request handlers. E.g. to support Protocol Buffers as an alternative request / response format.

These features can be created in separate repositories without ever leaving a notice.  
In case there is demand I would create a new section linking to these projects.

All these contributions are absolutely welcome!

In case a Pull Request is required
- Create a **New issue** mentioning you want to create a Pull Request
- A Pull request in [friflo/Friflo.Json.Fliox](https://github.com/friflo/Friflo.Json.Fliox) will require signing a CLA.
