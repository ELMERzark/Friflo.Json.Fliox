## `FlioxClient`
namespace **`Friflo.Json.Fliox.Hub.Client`**

The intention of `FlioxClient` is extending it by a domain specific class. See example below.  
Instances of this class are acting as **clients** to access database **containers**
and execute database **commands**.

Additional to using class instances as clients it also defines a **database schema**.  
It can be assigned as a `DatabaseSchema` to an `EntityDatabase` instance for
- **JSON Validation** of entities / records written to a container
- **Code generation** of various programming languages.  
  Built-In supported languages are: **Typescript**, **C#**, **Kotlin**, **JSON Schema** / **OpenAPI**, **GraphQL** and **HTML**.
- Support of generic database clients like the [**Hub Explorer**](../../Fliox.Hub.Explorer/README.md)


``` csharp
public class ShopStore : FlioxClient
{
    // --- containers
    public readonly EntitySet <long, Article>     articles;

    // --- commands
    public CommandTask<string> Hello (string param) => SendCommand<string, string> ("Hello", param);
    
    public ShopStore(FlioxHub hub) : base(hub) { }
}

public class Article
{
    public  long        id { get; set; }
    public  string      name;
}
```

Using this setup the `ShopStore` offer two main functionalities:
-   Define a **database schema** by declaring its containers, commands and messages
-   Instances of `ShopStore` are **clients** providing
    type-safe access to the database containers, commands and messages  

In detail:
- **containers** - are fields or properties of type `EntitySet<TKey,T>`
- **commands**   - are methods returning a `CommandTask<TResult>`
- **messages**   - are methods returning a `MessageTask`

## container operations
Containers are declared as fields or properties of type `EntitySet<TKey,T>`.  
`EntitySet<TKey,T>` methods provide all **common operations** to access or mutate the
entities / records stored in a container / table.  
These container operations are:
- **Create** entities
- **Read** entities by id - primary key
- **Upsert** entities
- **Delete** entities
- **Patch** entities - update only specific entity fields (columns)
- **Query** entities using a LINQ filter - optionally using a cursor to iterate large datasets
- **Read relations** - read entities referenced by entities returned by a **Read** or **Query** task.  
  This is the analog method to a **JOIN** in **SQL**.
- **Aggregate** / **Count** entities using a **LINQ filter**
- **Subscribe** to entity changes - **create**, **upsert**, **delete** & **patch** - made by other clients


## database commands & messages

A client also offer the possibility to send and subscribe commands and messages.  
In detail:

- **Send** a message / command by passing its name and an optional parameter - commonly called `param`.  
  The `param` can be any JSON type like: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object` or `array`.  
  The difference between command and message is:
  - a **command** return a **result** - a command is primarily used to execute a domain specific operation on the Hub.  
    Therefore a command requires a **message handler** in the `TaskHandler` assigned to a database.
  - a **message** return **void**     - messages are used to send notifications to the Hub and to other clients connected to the Hub.  
    Adding a **message handler** for a message in the `TaskHandler` is optional.

- **Subscribe** messages / commands send to a Hub by passing their name and a handler method or lambda.  
  - The Hub forward message / command events **only** to clients which have subscribed.  
    *In other words:* A Hub don't forward message / command events to a client unsolicited.  
  - This approach enables subscribing messages / events send from other clients **without** changing / deploying the Hub.  
    The client user need to be **authorized** to subscribe specific message & command events.


## Client usage

Instances of `ShopStore` can be used on server and client side.

To access a database using the `ShopStore` a `FlioxHub` is required.

``` csharp
public static async Task AccessDatabase() {
    var database    = new FileDatabase("shop", new MessageHandler());
    // or other database implementations like: MemoryDatabase, SQLite, Postgres, ...
    var hub         = new FlioxHub(database);
    var store       = new ShopStore(hub);
    
    var hello           = store.Hello("World");
    var createArticle   = store.articles.Upsert(new Article() { id = 1, name = "Bread" });
    var stats           = store.std.Stats(null);

    await store.SyncTasks();
    
    Console.WriteLine(hello.Result);
    // output:  hello World!
    Console.WriteLine($"createArticle.Success: {createArticle.Success}");
    // output:  createArticle.Success: True
    foreach (var container in stats.Result.containers) {
        Console.WriteLine($"{container.name}: {container.count}");
    }
    // output:  articles: 1
}
```

## Schema generation

As mentioned above `ShopStore` also defines a database schema.  
A database schema is the declaration of database **containers**, **commands** and **messages**.  

All declarations are expressed as types in a schema. This principle enables code generation as types
for other programming languages.

Schema generation is integral part of the [HTTP Hub](../Host/README.md#httphost).  
So all generated files and their zip archives are available via urls.

Alternatively code can be generated with C# using `SchemaModel.GenerateSchemaModels()`

The following example generate the types for Typescript, C#, Kotlin, JSON Schema / OpenAPI, GraphQL and HTML based on the
passed schema type `ShopStore`. The generated code is written to folder `./schema/`

``` csharp
public static void GenerateSchemaModels() {
    var schemaModels = SchemaModel.GenerateSchemaModels(typeof(ShopStore));
    foreach (var schemaModel in schemaModels) {
        var folder = $"./schema/{schemaModel.type}";
        schemaModel.WriteFiles(folder);
    }
}
```
