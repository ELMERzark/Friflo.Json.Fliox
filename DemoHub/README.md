## General

The **Fliox DemoHub** is used to demonstrate the features of [**JSON Fliox Hub**](https://github.com/friflo/Friflo.Json.Fliox) library via a Web project.

The key features of [**JSON Fliox Hub**](https://github.com/friflo/Friflo.Json.Fliox) are:
- provide **JSON based Web API**s to access **key-value** or **document** databases.
- Add a **database schema** to these database as they typically don't have a build-in solution
- Aim for near optimal request performance regarding **low latency** and **high throughput**
- enables efficient TDD as database access can be tested with **in-memory** or **file-system** based databases.
- hosts a single-page Web App to test and administrate a Host.
